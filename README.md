# hanabi-cmdline
Command line proof of concept for the card game Hanabi. 

This code contains the game logic concerning gameplay and rules. I didn't get to finish it 100% (I'd say this is 85% done) though the teacher did approve of our final work (along with the Android front-end, not in this repo).
